If you mistakenly created your venv already and want to use git to download aba-quickplot into that directory, you can use this method:
Navigate to the target directory:
bash
cd /path/to/my/existing/folder
Initialize a Git repository in the existing directory:
bash
git init
This creates a .git subdirectory in your current directory.
Add the remote repository:
bash
git remote add origin <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the Git repository you want to clone.
Fetch the remote contents:
bash
git fetch origin
This downloads the repository data, including branches and commits, without checking out any files yet.
Checkout the desired branch:
bash
git checkout -t origin/main
